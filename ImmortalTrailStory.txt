The story you are about to experience is one filled with choices. Some of these choices will be easy and others will truly make you think. Every question has a good choice, a bad choice, and a neutral one along with a wildcard answer that falls under one of these categories. Based on your decisions, the story will change and adapt in different unique ways. 




[S1  -  It has been a long boring day without much excitement, so of course you’ve found yourself lazily walking into the local tavern to drink the night away with people you don’t know, and don’t care to meet. As you finish drowning yourself in your fifth ale of the night, you scan the faces of the other patrons, looking for someone that seems like fun. Eventually you lock eyes with a gorgeous girl whom you’ve never met before. She’s a young brown eyed girl with medium length black hair. She’s wearing a red crop top and black pants with a red rope-belt. You begin to feel something that you haven’t felt in a thousand years and think to yourself, ‘Am I nervous about speaking to her?’. You debate in your head if you should approach or not.]


Question 1: Do I approach
* Yes  +10
[S1.1  -  You have decided to approach the girl. As you move closer to her, it becomes apparent that you’ve truly never seen a woman so beautiful in all your many years on Earth. You choose to buy her a drink to strike up conversation, she tells you her name is Luna, and as you talk to each other, you really begin to hit it off. About an hour into your conversation, she tells you that she needs to leave, but she would love to see you again. “Any ideas as to what we could do?” she asks. You ponder the question for a minute, then ask if she would like to…”]
* Make eye contact, see if she makes a move -0
        [S1.2  -  You decide to stay where you are, make eye contact, and see if she makes the first move. You’ve been alive for long enough to know that it’s a lot more fun when you make other people make the first move. After about 15 minutes, she begins to make her way over to you, grabbing a couple drinks along the way. She says something about you playing hard to get, and you simply smile and after learning her name, Luna, you begin to spark up a conversation. About an hour into your conversation, she tells you that she needs to leave, but she would love to see you again. “Any ideas as to what we could do?” she asks. You ponder the question for a minute, then ask if she would like to…”]
* No -10
        [S1.3  -  You decide that it isn’t worth your time, and start to mind your own business. After a while of small talk with other patrons, someone taps on your shoulder from behind. You quickly spin around and see the woman from across the tavern was the one getting your attention. She tells you how rude it is to ignore someone’s explicit hints. You shrug it off and make up a bad excuse, saying that you didn’t realize she wanted to talk to you. She doesn’t believe you at all, and you decide to make it up to her by buying her a drink. You learn that her name is Luna, and the two of you quickly hit it off with her and after about an hour of laughter and conversation, she tells you that she needs to leave, but she would love to see you again. “Any ideas as to what we could do?” she asks. You ponder the question for a minute, then ask if she would like to…”]
* Throw something(meme + 1) -10
        [S1.4  -  You decide to do probably the dumbest thing possible to get her attention, and throw something at her. Luckily she notices at the last second, and catches it out of the air just before it hits her. She angrily makes her way toward you as you try to come up with an excuse. “Excuse me, why the hell would you throw something at me like that? Do you realize how much that could’ve hurt me?” You quickly apologize and tell her that you weren’t thinking, and offer to buy her a drink to make up for the poor decision. She tells you that her name is Luna, and reluctantly accepts the drink, and you end up really enjoying each other’s company. After about an hour of laughter and conversation, she tells you that she needs to leave, but she would love to see you again. “Any ideas as to what we could do?” she asks. You ponder the question for a minute, then ask if she would like to…”]


        Question 2: Conversation/ Make Plans
* Go for a walk +5
        [S2.1  -  You decide that a walk might be the best choice, and with a big smile on her face, she accepts. You discuss when and where to walk, and she turns to leave. Before she has a chance to exit the tavern, you hear the door fling open.]
* Dinner -0
        [S2.2  -  You ask about taking her out to dinner, and she agrees that dinner would be wonderful. As you talk about where you should go the tavern door bursts open, and everyone immediately turns toward the door.]
* Tennis(meme + 1) -0
        [S2.3  -  “How about we go play tennis sometime?” you offer, hoping she enjoys physical activity. “Ummmmm… what’s tennis exactly?” she asks with a confused look on her face. ‘Damn, I forgot that hasn’t been invented yet…’ you think to yourself while trying to come up with a believable recovery. “Let’s just go to dinner then!” As she thinks about the offer, the tavern door cracks open with a rush of air.]
* Go see a play -5
        [S2.4  -  You suggest seeing a play, but she seems a little hesitant about it. I quickly think of an alternative, and ask about going on a walk together. She happily accepts and turns toward the door as it slams open with a gust of cold air.]


        [S3  -  An angry elf begins to shout “Where is that awful fire slinger?!” You immediately recognize the elf as Gideon, the immortal wielder of the air element. Gideon has always been a bit of a hot head, and if you were being completely honest, your element, fire, probably would’ve fit him much better. Gideon hated you more than anything because he had been searching for the source of your immortal element for centuries before he eventually found that you had already been to the source and claimed the power. Gideon meets your eye, and floats over to you, visibly angered. “I’ve been looking for you for a very long time, you know that, flame-face?” you look him in the eye and say a few simple words, “Leave me alone, windbag.” You say these simple words with a sharp tongue, letting a small flame flicker in your eyes before shoving past him, grabbing Luna’s arm, and leaving with a quiet, “We need to leave” directed toward her.]


        Question 3: Nani the fuck was that about?
* I know a bit about it, let me tell you. +15
   * Vague Explanation
        [S3.1  -  “What was that? Who was that? Are we in danger? Why was he so angry?” Luna was spitting out questions faster than you could even hope to answer them. “Luna, please stop and listen. There’s a lot about this world that you don’t know, and even I have only scratched the surface of reality.” You try pull her into an alley and hold her by the shoulders, “Immortality is real, gods are real, and magic is real. I don’t know a lot about it, but I do know about that elf. He’s immortal and controls the element of air. He’s a very dangerous person, and we need to stay away from him at all costs.” She asks you to tell her what you know about immortality, and how to get it. What do you tell her?...]
* IDK -0
   * LI Chases other immortal
        [S3.2  -  Luna breaks free of your grasp and runs toward Gideon, yelling out for him, trying to get him to tell her what exactly is going on. “Luna wait! I can tell you everything that I know, just please stay away from that man. He’s more dangerous than you know.” I yell after her, and she reluctantly comes back to me. “What is he? What makes him so dangerous?” she asked with an annoyed tone. “Luna, I need you to listen to me carefully, your world is about to completely change. Immortality is real, gods are real, and magic is real. I don’t know a lot about it, but I do know about that elf. He’s immortal and controls the element of air. He’s a very dangerous person, and we need to stay away from him at all costs.” She asks you to tell her what you know about immortality, and how to get it. What do you tell her?...]
* I have immortality. -15
   * LI freaks out, MC explains
        [S3.3  -  Luna begins to frantically ask you questions about what just happened, and who that elf was. She asks you what he meant when he called you a ‘fire slinger’, and at that point, you knew that you had to tell her what you were. You thought for a minute about how you should tell her, and eventually decided not to show off your powers just yet. “Luna, I don’t know the best way to tell you this, but immortality is real. The elf that you just saw is Gideon, he’s an immortal, that controls the power of air. Gideon hates me because he’s always wanted to gain the immortal powers of fire, which I just so happen to have.” You can see Luna’s eyes widen as you tell her about your life. You go on to tell her about how you gained your immortality, and you explain to her that only one person can wield the power of a specific element at once, and that the wielders of each element are the most powerful immortals in existence, and are rivaled only by the gods themselves. Luna seems determined to gain immortality for herself and begs you to tell her how she can get it. What do you tell her?...]
* Show off (meme +1) -15
   * LI freaks out, MC explains
        [S3.4  -  Luna begins to frantically ask you questions about what just happened, and who that elf was. She asks you what he meant when he called you a ‘fire slinger’, and at that point, you knew that you had to tell her what you were. You thought for a minute about how you should tell her, and eventually decided to simply show her your powers. You step away from her, and tell her to stand back a bit so that she doesn’t get hurt, then you create a ball of fire the size of a soft ball in each hand. You begin to juggle the fireballs, and show off a bit as you add more into the mix. Luna starts to get annoyed by you showing off, and she decides to throw an empty bottle at you, causing you to drop the fireballs you created. You quickly put out the small fires as she begins to scold you for showing off. You quickly apologize and admit that the chance to freely use your powers got the best of you. Luna seems to still be confused about your powers, and repeats the questions from before. You go on to tell her about how you gained your immortality, and you explain to her that only one person can wield the power of a specific element at once, and that the wielders of each element are the most powerful immortals in existence, and are rivaled only by the gods themselves. Luna seems determined to gain immortality for herself and begs you to tell her how she can get it. What do you tell her?...]


        Question 4: Where can I gain immortality?
* Fountain of Youth (meme + 1) +10
        [S4.1  -  After thinking about the ways one can gain immortality, and what you should tell her about it, you decide that the Fountain of Youth is the best choice for her. “One of the easiest ways to gain immortality is by visiting, and drinking from, the Fountain of Youth.” You notice an immediate reaction from her as you mention the Fountain. “Wait, the Fountain of Youth is a real thing? I always thought that was just a myth! Where is it? Can you take me there?” she seems overly excited to drink some old dusty water from the Fountain, but you can’t help but smile about the juvenile happiness she shows at the thought of the Fountain being real. “I don’t know where the Fountain resides, but I do know someone that might.” You decide to take her to see the wise Old Hag of the Forest, a woman that is said to know everything there is to know.]
* Potion -0
        [S4.2  -  After thinking about the ways one can gain immortality, and what you should tell her about it, you decide that brewing a potion may be the best choice for her. “One of the easiest ways to gain immortality is by drinking a potion. The recipe is complex, and difficult to master, but it is reliable, and easy to learn.” She seems excited at the thought of immortality, and asks if you know the recipe. “I knew it once, but that memory is long gone by now. I do however, know of a woman that may know the exact knowledge we seek.” You decide to take her to see the wise Old Hag of the Forest, a woman that is said to know everything there is to know.]
* Soul binding +10
        [S4.3  -  After thinking about the ways one can gain immortality, and what you should tell her about it, you choose to tell her about binding her soul to an item. “There’s a rare ancient magic that originated with the Old Gods that allows you to bind your soul to an item. The process has been forgotten by most, and as such, there are very few that know how to break this form of immortality.” She seems excited to try the binding, but worried that she doesn’t have anything to bind herself to. “Don’t get too excited yet, I don’t personally know the magic to bind a soul. For that, we’ll have to visit an old friend of mine.” You decide to take her to see the wise Old Hag of the Forest, a woman that is said to know everything there is to know.]
* Make a Deal With a God -10
        [S4.4  -  “The first thing that comes to mind when I think about easy immortality is making a deal with a god. I don’t necessarily recommend that one as the gods can be somewhat… troublesome.” She seems a little confused, but decides not to ask what you mean. “So where exactly can we talk to a god to even accomplish this?” She seems a little hesitant, but still wants to go through with it. She truly is determined to gain immortality. “We’ll have to visit an old friend of mine.” You decide to take her to see the wise Old Hag of the Forest, a woman that is said to know everything there is to know.]


[S5  -  While on your way to the Hag’s hut, Luna inquires about immortality, and what it’s like to live for so long, with no death in sight. You think about your answer for a while, but eventually come to a conclusion...]
Question 5: What’s it like to be immortal?
* I have so much time +5
         [S5.1  -  “Immortality can be really nice at times, because I have all the time in the world to do whatever I’ve ever wanted to do. I’ve had every job that I’ve ever dreamed of. I’ve been poor, I’ve been rich, I’ve been both an officer of the law, and and a criminal. I’ve lived a thousand lives, and I’m going to live a thousand more. That truly is the best part of being immortal. There’s nothing that I can’t accomplish.”]
* There’s so much room for activities (meme + 1) +5
        [S5.2  -  “Oh immortality is wonderful! I’ve travelled the world, and been to every country on the planet. I can go anywhere and do anything. The best part about that freedom… There is SO much room for activities!” I say this with a huge smile on my face, and obvious excitement in my voice. “Gods I love this world!”]
* It gets kinda boring - 0
        [S5.3  -  “In all honesty, immortality can get really boring. Years go by like days, and there are decades that you really don’t do anything. I’ve done everything that I’ve ever wanted to, and now I’m not sure what else to do.” Luna notices the hint of sadness in my voice and apologizes quickly, “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you. I was just curious.” I do my best to comfort her, promising that I’m not upset, and that boredom is just an unfortunate reality of immortality. She apologizes again, but quickly regains her happy composure, “Well now that I’m going to be immortal, maybe we can find new things to do together!”]
* Everyone dies - 5
        [S5.4  -  “It’s a lonely eternity, living forever. I was born a great many years ago, and everyone that I once loved died long long ago. The only people that I can truly connect with are other immortals, but they’re usually a bit untrustworthy to be completely honest with you. Most of them want to be the only immortal still alive, while others just want to be the strongest of all the immortals. There are very few that know how I came about my immortality, and of those, none that know every detail of it. Most immortals are scared of me, and those that aren’t either don’t care about me, or want me dead.” Luna was a bit taken aback by my serious response to what she saw as a simple question. I quickly apologized for changing the tone of our journey like that, and assured her that immortality wasn’t all bad.]
        
[S6  -  You arrive at the Old Hag’s home in the forest, and you can sense Luna’s nervousness as you knock on the door. The Old Hag opens the door with a sour look on her face “What do you need? And who is this… mortal?” She spits the question out like a snake spits venom. You can tell that Luna is shaken by the Hag’s attitude, and you hope that the Hag doesn’t pray on that, though you know she might. “My friend here seeks immortality, and after all my years on this Earth, I figured you would be the best person to go to for assistance with that quest.” The Hag reluctantly invites you inside and tells you both of all the ways that a mortal can achieve immortality. “There, now that you know of all the ways I know, get out of my home. I’ve grown tired of entertaining guests.” You leave the Hag’s hut, and journey off to seek immortality for Luna.]


        [S7  -  Luna seems very excited that she’s finally going to gain the immortality she desires, but she also seems conflicted, “So, what would be the easiest way for me to get immortality? Where should we go, and what should we do?” You think for a while about what to tell her...]
Question 6: How do we get me immortality?
* Tell her exactly about your immortality -20
        [S7.1  -  “I think that the best plan of action would be to go to my home. It is a hidden cave at the peak of a volcano, and the place where I gained my immortality. When we get there, we can plan our next steps, get some rest, and properly prepare for the journey ahead of us.” Luna thinks about your answer and starts hatching a dark plan in her head. “Tell me more about your powers, I wanna know how we can take out that Gideon guy.” You should’ve been cautious from the get go. You should’ve suspected that she was planning something, but you didn’t expect what was going to happen. “An elemental wielder gains their immortality by being killed in a specific location, by a specific item. The only way to remove this form of immortality is to get the elemental back to that location, and kill them with the item that gave their powers in the first place. After a few thousand years, I finally found Gideon’s elemental lair, deep in the heart of a mountain, guarded by a dragon.” She thought about this for a moment, unbeknownst to you, she was planning to use this against you. Luna wanted to be the fire immortal. The two of you arrive at the volcanic cave where you were reborn, and begin to settle in. You show her around, and she finds the flaming dagger that bestowed the flames upon you. Hours later, you head to bed, exhausted by the days of travel you just went through, and as you rested, she snuck into your chambers and stabbed you in your sleep. You awaken to the sharp pain of a dagger in your stomach, and the flames flowing out of your body. The last thing you see is Luna’s eyes, and maniacal grin as the eternal life leaves your body.]
* Tell her about killing air - 0
        [S7.2  -  “I think that the best plan of action would be to go to my home. It is a hidden cave at the peak of a volcano, and the place where I gained my immortality. When we get there, we can plan our next steps, get some rest, and properly prepare for the journey ahead of us.” Luna mulls this over momentarily, and comes up with an idea, “What if we kill Gideon?” This question comes as a shock to you because you never would’ve expected this girl to suggest murder, but you aren’t against it. “In all honesty, I’ve thought of that myself in the past, and even gone so far as to find his lair, and infiltrate it. I think that getting in should be entirely possible, the hard part is having him be there.” She seems confused about this, “Why do we have to get him there? How does his immortality work?” You realize that you never really explained elemental immortality to her,  “An elemental wielder gains their immortality by being killed in a specific location, by a specific item. The only way to remove this form of immortality is to get the elemental back to that location, and kill them with the item that gave their powers in the first place. After a few thousand years, I finally found Gideon’s elemental lair, deep in the heart of a mountain, guarded by a dragon. The only reason he still breathes is the fact that he has never been back there at the same time as me.” You arrive at your volcanic cave, and show Luna around, she quickly settles in, and you begin to formulate a plan. You decide to go to his mountain and find the best way for you both to get in undetected. As you arrive at the mountain, you notice that the great dragon is asleep, and there is light coming from the cave. “There’s no way he’s actually here right now, we can’t be this lucky.” Luna hears the surprise in your voice, and reminds you that this was just supposed to be a practice entry. “Yeah, I get that, but if we have the chance to end this, we should do it now. We don’t know when we’ll ever have this opportunity again.” She silently accepts this, and you slip through the holes in the cave walls, entering a side chamber that leads toward your goal. Luna heads the opposite direction, looking for the item to kill Gideon, and you go toward the main living chambers to confront him one final time. You step into the room he’s in and set yourself alight, immediately giving up your element of surprise. You know that you don’t have to win this fight, you simply have to distract him long enough for Luna to kill him. Off in a hidden room, Luna hears a faint sound, and sees a pure white dagger. She grabs the dagger and feels the power running through her. She goes toward the main chamber as fast as she can to end Gideon’s miserable eternity once and for all. She sneaks into the room where you and Gideon are fighting, and avoids being hit by the fireballs and gusts of air being thrown around. As quietly as possible, Luna dashes behind gideon and stabs him in the back with the dagger, releasing a powerful barrage of air out in every direction. Luna pulls the dagger from Gideon’s lifeless body, and impales herself with it, immediately feeling the power enter her body, as her eyes glow bright white. She has finally become immortal.]
* Mention falling in love with a god (meme + 1) - 0
         [S7.3  -  “I think that the best plan of action would be to go to my home. It is a hidden cave at the peak of a volcano, and the place where I gained my immortality. When we get there, we can plan our next steps, get some rest, and properly prepare for the journey ahead of us.”]
* Offer up soul binding +20
