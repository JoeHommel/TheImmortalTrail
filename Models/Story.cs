You should’ve suspected that she was planning something, but you didn’t expect what was going to happen. “An elemental wielder gains their immortality by being killed in a specific location, by a specific item.

I think that getting in should be entirely possible, the hard part is having him be there.” She seems confused about this, “Why do we have to get him there?

As you arrive at the mountain, you notice that the great dragon is asleep, and there is light coming from the cave. “There’s no way he’s actually here right now, we can’t be this lucky.” Luna hears the surprise in your voice, and reminds you that this was just supposed to be a practice entry. “Yeah, I get that, but if we have the chance to end this, we should do it now. We don’t know when we’ll ever have this opportunity again.” She silently accepts this, and you slip through the holes in the cave walls, entering a side chamber that leads toward your goal. Luna heads the opposite direction, looking for the item to kill Gideon, and you go toward the main living chambers to confront him one final time. You step into the room he’s in and set yourself alight, immediately giving up your element of surprise. You know that you don’t have to win this fight, you simply have to distract him long enough for Luna to kill him. Off in a hidden room, Luna hears a faint sound, and sees a pure white dagger. She grabs the dagger and feels the power running through her. She goes toward the main chamber as fast as she can to end Gideon’s miserable eternity once and for all. She sneaks into the room where you and Gideon are fighting, and avoids being hit by the fireballs and gusts of air being thrown around. As quietly as possible, Luna dashes behind gideon and stabs him in the back with the dagger, releasing a powerful barrage of air out in every direction. Luna pulls the dagger from Gideon’s lifeless body, and impales herself with it, immediately feeling the power enter her body, as her eyes glow bright white. She has finally become immortal.";

The Hag drops the robe from her shoulders, and reveals that she’s actually the beautiful fire goddess, Kirara. “Ever since you left my hut, I’ve been searching for you. I cannot get that mortal girl out of my mind. I must make her mine.” Luna stands with a look of shock on her face. “Wait, you want me to be yours?

The only way I can die is by being killed here, and you’re the only person that has been here with me in a millenia.” She looks at you like you have three heads, but then she thought about it for a minute, and realized that it’s actually a really good idea. “I actually think that might work! Now all that’s left is to figure out the magic used to bind a soul. Do you think that the Old Hag might know how to do it?” I hadn’t even thought about that, but as soon as Luna said it, I remembered that the Old Hag actually gave me an ancient tome holding magic that had been lost to the passage of time. I begin ripping books of the shelves in a hurry, trying to find it, and eventually grab the exact book that I was looking for. Luna asks me what the tome is, and I explain that I may know exactly how to bind her soul to me, but she would have to do the magic. “Wait, I can’t do that, I’ve never used magic before. Hell, a week ago I didn’t even know it was a thing, how am I supposed to do ancient magic?” You give her a reassuring look, “I know you can do it, Luna, you’re stronger than you think. To go through everything that you’ve gone through in the past week, and still want to be immortal, you have to be strong.” She smiles and you walk her through the process, making sure she remembers every step perfectly, then you lay on the floor, ready to have her soul bound to me. I wake up a few hours later, and feel a warmth in my chest, knowing that part of Luna’s soul resides in me now. I look at her and say a few simple words, “I’m ready to spend eternity with you.”";
